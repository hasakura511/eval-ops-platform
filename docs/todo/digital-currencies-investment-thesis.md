# TODO: Digital Currencies — Investment Thesis for an Age of Uncertainty

## Status
- [ ] Draft for review
- [ ] Edit for clarity and structure
- [ ] Validate claims with sources

## Plan
1. **Position the premise**
   - Define money as a coordination system under uncertainty.
   - Explain why this reframing matters for digital currencies.
2. **Reframe classical money functions**
   - Medium of exchange → medium of risk transfer.
   - Unit of account → unit of value across time.
   - Store of value → store of optionality.
3. **Show how belief is priced**
   - Markets compress disagreement into price.
   - Hedging vs. speculation as stabilizers.
4. **Explain why digital currencies matter**
   - Neutral settlement under distrust.
   - Permissionless execution once price is agreed.
5. **Lay out the investment case**
   - When they outperform vs. underperform.
   - Emphasize the macro bet on uncertainty.
6. **Risks and limits**
   - Institutional stabilization.
   - Regulatory centralization.
   - Speculative excess vs. real use.
7. **Bottom line**
   - Money prices risk and rents flexibility.
   - Digital currencies optimize the transaction layer post-disagreement.

## Draft Notes

### The premise
Money is commonly described as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Those definitions are incomplete for a world where the dominant constraint is no longer trade, but uncertainty.

A more accurate modern definition is this:

> Money is a shared accounting and incentive system that turns value, time, risk, and belief into comparable numbers — making cooperation possible under uncertainty.

Digital currencies matter because they optimize this function under conditions of disagreement, distrust, and institutional instability.

### The problem money actually solves today
Modern economies are not constrained by the ability to trade goods. They are constrained by the need to act before certainty exists:

- Political authority is contested
- Regulation shifts rapidly
- Institutions disagree across borders
- Narratives move faster than rules

Yet decisions still must be made. Capital must move. Contracts must settle.

Money’s primary role is not exchange — it is coordination without consensus.

### Reframing the classical functions of money
**Medium of exchange → Medium of risk transfer**

Every exchange is implicitly a transfer of risk:

- Counterparty risk
- Time risk
- Regulatory risk
- Information risk

Money enables those risks to be priced, shifted, and settled.

What looks like a simple exchange is actually a risk trade. The good changes hands, but so does uncertainty.

Exchange is downstream of risk pricing — not the core function.

**Unit of account → Unit of value across time**

Money does not merely measure value. It measures value discounted through time and uncertainty.

Prices encode:

- Delay
- Opportunity cost
- Volatility
- Expectations about future states of the world

This is why interest rates, not prices alone, are foundational. Money exists to compare now vs later, certain vs uncertain.

Without the temporal element, “value” is meaningless.

**Store of value → Store of optionality**

The idea that money “stores value” is structurally false.

- Inflation is persistent
- Opportunity cost is constant
- Idle money decays in real terms

Money is not meant to preserve value. It is meant to preserve optionality — the ability to decide later, when information improves.

That option has a cost. Value decays because flexibility is not free.

### Pricing belief instead of resolving it
Markets do not eliminate disagreement. They compress it into prices.

Two symmetric forces keep this system functional:

- **Hedging**, which resists uncertainty by paying to reduce exposure
- **Speculation**, which resists false certainty by betting against overconfident prices

Hedging protects actors who cannot tolerate volatility. Speculation protects the system from premature consensus.

Together, they stabilize decision-making without requiring agreement.

### When belief is priced, what remains is transactional
Once value, time, risk, and belief are reduced to numbers:

- Arguments become positions
- Trust becomes settlement
- Coordination becomes execution

You no longer need persuasion. You need rules that clear.

This is the residue of the system: transaction.

### Why digital currencies matter here
Digital currencies do not primarily succeed because they are:

- Better inflation hedges
- Faster payment rails
- Replacements for fiat

They succeed because they are neutral settlement layers under disagreement.

They assume:

- Distrust is normal
- Authority is fragmented
- Certainty is temporary

Once a price is agreed to, execution does not depend on discretion, interpretation, or permission.

They minimize friction at the only step that remains once belief is priced.

### Why speculation dominates digital assets
Speculation is not noise — it is structural.

Digital currencies sit at the boundary between:

- Belief and institution
- Narrative and rule
- Future and present

Speculation here hedges against certainty itself — against prices that imply more confidence than reality supports.

Volatility is the visible cost of repricing trust in real time.

### The investment case
Digital currencies outperform traditional systems when:

- Trust is expensive
- Jurisdictions conflict
- Rules change faster than institutions adapt
- Coordination must happen globally and permissionlessly

They underperform when:

- Authority is stable
- Rules are clear
- Trust is cheap

This is not a technology bet. It is a macro bet on uncertainty.

### Risks
- Stabilized institutions compress the uncertainty premium
- Regulatory centralization reduces settlement advantage
- Excess speculation without transactional use erodes credibility
- Adoption is conditional, not inevitable

### Bottom line
Money does not store value. It prices risk across time and rents flexibility at a cost.

Digital currencies are optimized for a world where:

- Belief must be priced
- Certainty must be challenged
- And once disagreement is compressed into numbers, all that remains is transaction

They are money built for that remainder.
